# Customer Churn Prediction Project

## Overview

This repository contains data exploration, analysis, and model building to predict the likelihood of customer churn. The main notebook `churn.ipynb` includes all the steps for preprocessing, analysis, and model training.

## Project Structure

* `churn.ipynb` — the main Jupyter Notebook (data analysis, cleaning, model training, and evaluation).
* `README.md` — this file, explaining how to run the project and its requirements.

## Key Features

* Data loading and exploratory data analysis (EDA)
* Data cleaning and feature engineering
* Train/test data split
* Multiple classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost — depending on installed libraries)
* Model evaluation (accuracy, confusion matrix, ROC-AUC)
* Optionally saving the final trained model

## Requirements

It is recommended to use Python 3.8+ (you mentioned earlier that you are using Python 3.11).

Example `requirements.txt`:

```
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
matplotlib
seaborn
jupyter
xgboost
joblib
```

Install dependencies via:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Notebook

1. Open the terminal in the project folder.
2. Start Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab:

```bash
jupyter notebook
# or
jupyter lab
```

3. Open `churn.ipynb` and run the cells sequentially. Some cells may depend on local dataset files — make sure the data is in the expected path or update the code accordingly.

## Workflow Summary

1. Import libraries and load data
2. Initial data inspection (`head`, `info`, `describe`, missing values)
3. Data cleaning (handle missing values, type conversions)
4. Feature engineering (encoding categorical features, creating new features)
5. Train/test split
6. Train models and optionally tune hyperparameters
7. Evaluate models and select the best one
8. Save the model and visualize results

## Practical Notes

* For faster experimentation, sample a subset of the data during development.
* Always keep a backup of the raw dataset.
* If you plan to use XGBoost or LightGBM, ensure they are installed in your environment.

## Possible Extensions

* Apply balancing techniques (e.g., SMOTE, undersampling) if the dataset is imbalanced.
* Build a dashboard to monitor performance metrics or generate weekly reports.
* Deploy the model as an API using Flask or FastAPI.

## License

Choose an appropriate license (e.g., MIT) and add a `LICENSE` file if you plan to share the project publicly.

If you’d like this README adapted to a GitHub template, or to include files like `requirements.txt` and `setup.py`, let me know and I can prepare them.
